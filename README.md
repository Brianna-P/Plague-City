# Plague-City
A 2D top-down game coded in Python3 using pygame

Welcome to Plague-City!! Help the diseased people of your village by venturing into the dangerous, rat-infested city.
The villagers need you to gather ingredients from the city or market to brew medicine for them, but beware the rats!!
A couple bites could mean the end of it all.

We hope you enjoy our game!
